            <h2>Hi! It's me.</h2>
            <p>
                Just your average 31-year old guy living in MÃ¶lndal with a passion
                for design & code. Currently working as lead designer and
                lead front-end developer at an affiliate company, running sites in
                personal finance and online gambling.
            </p>

            <p>
                I enjoy working in a fast-paced environment and thrive when given
                creative freedom. In my current position I wear many different
                hats: I design, develop and maintain everthing from our own
                internal systems to all of our external products.
            </p>

            <p>
                As seen in many of my projects I enjoy mixing vibrant colors with
                simplistic design, icons and clean patterns.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now enough about me. Scroll down and have a look at what I've been doing lately. Enjoy!
